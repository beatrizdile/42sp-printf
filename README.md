The **ft_printf** project at 42 school is an implementation of the **printf** function in C. This project aims to recreate the functionality of the standard **printf** function, which allows formatted output to the console or other output streams.

## Description

The goal of this project is to deepen your understanding of variadic functions, string formatting, and low-level output mechanisms in C. By completing this project, you will gain a strong grasp of string manipulation, handling different data types, and implementing various format specifiers.

The **ft_printf** function takes a format string, similar to **printf**, and allows for the formatting and printing of various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and more. It supports a wide range of format specifiers, including field width, precision, and flags.

## Features

- Support for `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, and more format specifiers
- Output formatted strings to the console or other output streams
- Support for variable argument lists using variadic functions
- Comprehensive error handling and support for edge cases
